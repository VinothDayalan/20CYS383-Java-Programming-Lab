helloworld.cpp is a C program that has been saved with a .cpp extension. 
Although the program is written in C, using the .cpp extension indicates 
that the file is intended to be compiled with a C++ compiler such as g++.

The program prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console, which is 
achieved by using the printf() function, a common function used for 
printing text in C and C++.

To compile the program using g++, the command g++ helloworld.cpp -o 
helloworld can be used. This will generate an executable file named 
helloworld, which can be run from the command line to execute the program 
and print the message to the console.

It's worth noting that although C and C++ are similar languages, there are 
some differences between them. Therefore, it's important to write C code 
that is compatible with a C++ compiler if you want to use a .cpp file 
extension and compile it with a C++ compiler like g++.
